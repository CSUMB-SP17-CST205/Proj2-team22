Project Explanation: At the beginning of the project, our plan was to make a Desktop Photo Editing app that would have
features like crop, filters, meme transformer, drawing, social media sharing. We can envision working on this project
in the future to fulfill our initial vision of the project. If we had more time we would have like to add sharing tools
for social media apps like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter.

How To Use Application: There are 5 buttons each with different functionality. First off is the upload picture button
that lets the user choose and image to work on. There is also a filter button to add to filters to the picture, and an
eraser button to remove all filters. Finally there is a crop and coloring button to crop the image on a canvas, and color
on top of the image.
